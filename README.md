# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify movies based on their genres using traditional machine learning techniques such as Na√Øve Bayes, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The classification is based on structured data.

## Features
- Preprocessing of movie dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand genre distribution
- Machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Movie Title:** The name of the movie
- **Movie Description:** A short synopsis of the movie plot
- **Genre:** The category or categories assigned to the movie (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy)

## Steps to Perform
### 1. Load the Data
   - Import dataset using Pandas.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

### 2. Preprocess the Data
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., genres) using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
   - Perform feature scaling if necessary.

### 3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize genre distribution using count plots.
   - Analyze basic statistics of numerical features.

### 4. Split the Dataset
   - Divide data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).

### 5. Train a Classification Model
   - Implement various ML models like Na√Øve Bayes, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
   - Tune hyperparameters for better performance.

### 6. Evaluate the Model
   - Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize performance using confusion matrix.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-genre-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-genre-classification
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Results
- The trained model achieves reliable accuracy in predicting movie genres using structured data.
- Visualization of genre distribution and model performance metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional machine learning models like Decision Trees and Random Forest.
- Explore ensemble learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
